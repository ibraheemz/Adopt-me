# Adopt Me!

Welcome to Adopt Me!, a React-based web application built as a practice for FrontEndMasters' Complete Intro to React lectures.

## Description

Adopt Me! is a simple web application that allows users to browse and adopt pets. This project was built using ReactJS, CSS, Bootstrap, HTTP, REST Architecture, Git, Responsive UI, and Asynchronous HTTP Requests.

The project is designed to help solidify the understanding of React and improve skills in front-end web development. Asynchronous HTTP requests were used to fetch pet data, which is then rendered using a responsive UI design. Git was used as the version control tool to manage the development process.
